# What is PATH-GDS?

PATH-GDS is a two-year program to introduce and train MS Statistics and MS Applied Mathematics students in genomics research. Our goal is to build an inclusive and representative community of genomic data scientists to foster retention in academia and industry by:

-   Training the scholars through coursework and rotations in genomics research

-   Immersing scholars in a 17-month laboratory experience

-   Exposing scholars to professional development through didactic seminars, panels, and workshops.

-   Preparing Scholars for future careers through soft skills training (eg: research communication, guidance for application in doctoral programs and industry positions)

-   Providing a strong community to help build scholars' identities as genomic data scientists
