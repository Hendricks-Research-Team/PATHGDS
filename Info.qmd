# What is PATH-GDS?

PATH-GDS is a two-year program to introduce and train MS Statistics and MS Applied Mathematics students in genomics research. Our goal is to introduce and train scholars in genomic data science to meet the increasing demands of a computationally and data driven genomics workforce by:

- Training scholars through coursework and rotations in genomics research.
    - Although scholars can take courses and complete rotations at both campuses, most coursework will be at CU Denverâ€™s Downtown Campus and most rotations are offered at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.
    - Scholars will get to be part of the campus communities at both CU Denver and CU Anshutz!
- Immersing scholars in a 17-month laboratory experience.
- Exposing scholars to professional development through didactic seminars, panels, and workshops.
- Preparing scholars for future careers through soft skills training (e.g., research communication, guidance for application in doctoral programs and industry positions).
- Providing a strong community to help retain scholars' as genomic data scientists (including industry as well as academia).

# What you will gain by being a PATH-GDS scholar?

PATH-GDS offers resources to support its scholars throughout the pathway program:

- Successful students will earn an MS in Statistics or Applied Mathematics in two years.
- Coursework through the program includes 3 genomics electives (including a course on ethics in biomedical research).
- Students will attend seminars and workshops in genomics, research, and professional skills
- Funding provided: \$25/hour for 15 hours of research during the academic year and 40 hrs/week during the summer.
- In-state tuition and student fees are covered by the program.
    - The Statistics and Applied Mathematics MS programs are part of WICHE, which allows students from selected states to receive in-state tuition even if they aren't Colorado residents. Currently, this includes residents of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, & U.S. Pacific Territories and Freely Associated States.
- The program offers a $1,350 health insurance stipend for the Fall and Spring semesters.
- Students will have the opportunity to attend a local or national conference.
- Students will participate in rotations and research experiences in wet (laboratory based) and dry (computational) genomics labs.
- Students will gain mentoring experience as both the mentee and mentor.
